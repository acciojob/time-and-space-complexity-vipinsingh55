    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. 
        It is important to analyze time complexity in order to choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. 
        An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.
