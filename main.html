	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the input size. It helps to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and allows developers to choose the most efficient one for their needs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for optimizing resource usage in applications.</p>
